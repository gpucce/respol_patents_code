@description: Merges the sequence of cosine similarity files
patent_cosine_all_i.txt, where i is an index for the number of file. Each
file correspond to a set of years. The output is cosine_similarity.txt as the
sequential merge of all the files.

This code is part of the article: "Natural Language Processing to Identify the
Creation and Impact of New Technologies in Patent Text: Code, Data, and New
Measures"
