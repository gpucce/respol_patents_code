@description: Extract a baseline vocabulary of indexed word combinations using
the file keywords_idx.txt. The vocabulary is formed by all the unique indexed
word combinations from patents filed before 1980. The output is
comb_[n]_baseline_vocabulary.txt, that contains the list of combinations of
n words from patents before 1980. n is the number of words in the combination
(2 or 3).

This code needs the data produced in the previous steps and stored in the
new_word/ directory.

This code is part of the article: "Natural Language Processing to Identify the
Creation and Impact of New Technologies in Patent Text: Code, Data, and New
Measures"
